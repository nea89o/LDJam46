Keep I.T. Alive - A coffee clicker about the worlds most turbulent tech company

You are the manager of a small (and slightly shady) I.T. department.
Hire new employees, buy upgrades and, most importantly, make sure you don't run out of coffee!


Watch out for the laser-pitchforks!


Unfortunately, we didn't manage to finish the UI details on time,
so here are some hints to help you keep I.T. alive:


**UPGRADES**
- *Coffee Contract:* Never worry about restocking coffee beans again!
- *Neos Sunglasses:* Increase the confidence (and productivity!) of your devs! May result in them to getting more... lets say aggressive during riots
- *Wage Slavery:* Overtime for everyone! Sure, the employees won't be happy about that but you'll earn more money!

**EMPLOYEES**
- *Intern:* Underpaid barista. More coffee for the devs!
- *Devolper:* Can't survive without that sweet, sweet Bean Juice. Turns coffee into money!
- *Lawyer:* You better not plead innocent in a trial if you don't hire an attorney first!

 - The konami code
 - The court ending is a reference to pong dance.
 - If you have the sunglasses upgrade, the devs will have laser pitchforks
 - The lawyers are a reference to Ace Attorney.
 - And probably more, but i forgot about a lot of them during development
