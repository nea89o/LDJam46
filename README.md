Keep I.T. Alive - A coffee clicker about the worlds most turbulent tech company

You are the manager of a small (and slightly shady) I.T. department.
Hire new employees, buy upgrades and, most importantly, make sure you don't run out of coffee!


Watch out for the laser-pitchforks!

## Upgrades

 - Sunglasses: Increases developer productivity, but also increases danger of riots
 - Wageslavery: Increases developer productivity, but also increases danger of riots and coffee consumption
 - Contract: Autobuys coffee beans and lowers the price with each additional upgrade.

 - The konami code
 - The court ending is a reference to pong dance.
 - If you have the sunglasses upgrade, the devs will have laser pitchforks
 - The lawyers are a reference to Ace Attorney.
 - And probably more, but i forgot about a lot of them during development
